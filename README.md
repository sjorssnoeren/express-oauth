Express OAuth
=============

### Note: not production ready
As this is a recently started project, development will continue for a while and alongside this plugin will grow. As all of it's code is subject to change, you still may use it but It's likely to change a lot. Also at this point it's shouldn't be used in production from a security point of view.

### Why?
Authentication is one of the (not to say, the) most time consuming module to develop when writing a REST API. While most of it's logic is almost identical for every project. Most Node.JS modules out there supply a toolkit to get you started, but there isn't one that is plug and play.

### Default Usage
#### Initialization

```
var oauth = new OAuth({
  hostname: 'localhost',
  collection: 'yourproject_oauth'
});
```

To be updated.
